### Software Engineer

With over eight years of experience using .NET, Golang, Node.js, Python, and Agile methodologies, I've developed a strong ability to adapt and deliver high-quality software solutions. In recent years, I've been deeply exploring Rust, a language I'm genuinely passionate about for its powerful features and efficiency.

I thrive on learning new programming languages and technologies, always aiming to leverage the right tools to effectively solve problems—because technology is valuable only when it provides meaningful solutions.

Fluent in both English and Vietnamese, I communicate clearly and confidently, ensuring my ideas are always effectively conveyed. My extensive experience collaborating with international clients in both onsite and remote settings has empowered me to work independently and efficiently, regardless of location.
