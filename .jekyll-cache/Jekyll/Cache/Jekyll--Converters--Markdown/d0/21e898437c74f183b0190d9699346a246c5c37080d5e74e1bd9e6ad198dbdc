<p>Photo Merge is an application that allows you to integrate the two images. Inspired by Follow me. (Windows Phone Store)
I began to do this while I was a sophomore student. This is project personal. Iâ€™ve earned a little money from it through I sales it on Window Phone store ways. I have many applications on the Windows Phone Store with a lot of categories different. But I didnâ€™t sales them on Window Phone store, I have put up advertisements on them to earn money from them, I have earned a bit of money from advertisement. Users can download them free from Window Phone store. I have earned so many scores from Nokia Develop websites where the developers post their application thereafter they get scores through review and rate from users on Window Phone store. They can exchange their scores with Nokiaâ€™s gifts. Thereâ€™s a Windows Phone contest held by Nokia.</p>
